# nitrate-cancer-gui
This application provides users a simple Graphical User Interface for exploring the relationship between Cancer rates and Nitrate levels in water across Wisconsin.

This application was developed for Geography 777 project #1

The application was built using ArcPy, ArcGIS Pro, and Tkinter with the custom Tkinter libraryâ€”for a more modern look and feel.
