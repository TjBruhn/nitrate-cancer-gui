High nitrate concentrations in drinking water are a known health hazard. Concerns about a possible cancer risk for adults from nitrate exposure have recently emerged. This tool allows users to explore the relationship between nitrate levels in well-water and rates of cancer.

Cancer rates are normalized by census tract population using data of the location of all cancer occurrences in Wisconsin over a ten-year period. Nitrate levels are from required water testing when new wells are dug or when existing wells are repaired by licensed contractors. 

The application uses inverse distance weighting (IDW) to produce a raster map of nitrate levels. Users may run the analysis for the distance exponent k for any k > 1. The application then runs a linear regression to model the potential relationship between nitrate concentrations and cancer occurrences.
